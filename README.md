# Balls

The goal of this fullstack excersize is to get to know how you learn, digest and implement new things. We expect you to write production quality code with todayâ€™s CSS and Javascript standards and clean object-oriented ruby code.

![Alt text](example.gif?raw=true "Balls")

## Your task

Create a centered box, with a drop button. It must be similar to the example gif.
Pressing the drop button yields the following results:

- If there are no balls in the box it inserts a pink ball.
- Every third ball is a green ball.
- Every fifth ball is a blue ball.
- Every fifteenth ball is a purple ball.
- Every other ball is a pink ball.

The sum shows the number of balls.

The score shows the sum of the balls scores:
- Pink Ball:   1
- Green Ball:  3
- Blue Ball:   5
- Purple Ball: 15

## Constraints

- After the html view is loaded with the empty box, JS takes over.
- The rendering of the balls must be in JS. no `innerHTML`, no server rendering after the box is loaded. You need to create the elements in the JS.
- The drop button fires a JSON request, sends down the number of balls, then backend responds in JSON which ball colour comes next.
- You can't use JS Libraries, no jQuery/Angular/React or any library, just vanilla JS.

## Bonus

- Use es6, and new browser features
